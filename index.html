      <h1>Data Deletion Request</h1>
      <p>
        Your privacy is our priority. This page provides instructions on how to
        request the deletion of your account and associated data from the
        Earzbook app.
      </p>

      <div class="instructions">
        <h2>How to Delete Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          We provide two ways for you to request the deletion of your data,
          fulfilling the requirements of the Google Play Store.
        </p>

        <h3>Option 1: In-App Account Deletion (Recommended)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Earzbook app and navigate to the
            'Settings' screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> At the bottom of the Settings screen, tap
            on the "Delete Account" button.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> A confirmation prompt will appear to ensure
            the action is intentional. Confirming this will permanently delete
            your account and all associated data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Option 2: Deletion via Email</h3>
        <p>
          If you are unable to access the app, you can request data deletion by
          sending an email to our support team.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Compose an email from the address
            associated with your Earzbook account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the subject line: "Data Deletion
            Request".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> In the body of the email, please state that
            you wish to delete your account and all associated data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Send the email to the address below. Our
            team will process your request and confirm via email once the
            deletion is complete.
          </li>
        </ul>
